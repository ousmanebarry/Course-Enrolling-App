# course-enrolling-app

## Introduction

Our App's main function and purpose is for students to enroll into their classes. We have three types of accounts for our app which are Students, Instructors and Admin. Student accounts can only enroll into courses, unenroll from courses and view all the courses they are already enrolled into.  Instructor accounts can view all created courses, search for them, assign and unassign themselves to courses theyâ€™d like to teach (that do not already have an instructor), and they can also add and edit course days, course hours, course description, and course student capacity. Lastly the admin accounts can create, edit and delete courses as well as accounts.
